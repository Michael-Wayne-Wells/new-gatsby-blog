Welcome to the Site! I'm in the process of building up this new personal site and blog. I'll be moving some of my old post and will be adding new content semi-regularly. Topics will include:

* Kubernetes
* Ruby on Rails
* Information Security
* Metrics and Monitoring
* Productivity
* Mental Health
* and anything else I might be learning about at the moment or want to discuss.
