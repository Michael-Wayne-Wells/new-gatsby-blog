## Experience

#### Tilig Password Manager - Full-Stack Software Engineer

###### March 2020 - January 2021

- Managed Kubernetes cluster which included performing updates, provisioning resources, configuring and setting up autoscaling node groups, setting and updating access policies, debugging issues, and monitoring performance.
- Earned ownership of infrastructure repository based on my successes working with AWS, Kubernetes, and the CI/CD pipeline. Here, I wrote and maintained Kubernetes yaml files and templates used for everything running in the cluster, set up version control for all infrastructure, built a custom Kubernetes helper that handled authentication and deployments from the CI/CD pipeline to the cluster, and wrote documentation for better future accessibility. 
- Maintained the AWS infrastructure where I configured the VPC and VPN, set up logging and monitoring for cost analysis and security, created and oversaw EC2 instances, managed IAM policies, worked with container images in ECR, and utilized EKS for the Kubernetes cluster.
- Created an automated development environment tool utilizing Docker, Docker Compose, VsCode, and custom Bash scripts. With a single command, it would clone all repositories, pull the necessary images, install dependencies, and start a local development server.  
- Successfully set up and maintained metrics and logging for the web application and cloud-based infrastructure utilizing Prometheus, Grafana, Fluentd, InfluxDB, and Elastic(Elk Stack) which allowed for better security monitoring, alerts for errors or downtime, and resource usage in AWS.
- Built a custom Gitlab CI/CD runner to allow a monorepo to be separated into separate services with individual pipelines that build, test, perform security scans, and deploy to AWS via EKS. Build times for the backend API were improved by up to 90% and configuration became more accessible to other developers from implementing infrastructure as code.
- Converted backend Node.JS based API to Ruby on Rails to better enable security features and promote quick development of features to the product.

#### Tuft & Needle - Quality Engineering Intern

###### March 2020 - May 2020

- Completed security scans and a penetration test of the company’s websites and backend services. For this, I utilized custom scripts written in Ruby and tools such as Burpsuite, Zaproxy, Snyk, and Nmap.  I wrote and submitted a full security report laying out vulnerabilities and recommendations for remediation.
- Contributed code to companies Cypress based end-to-end tests suite.
- Wrote documentation around how to set up their development environment which utilized Docker containers and Makefiles. 
- Personally reached out to the DevOps team to learn and better understand the work they were doing. This evolved into weekly voluntary learning sessions that other interns and members of the team attended and contributed to.
- Worked with engineering team to perform manual and automated testing on new features.

#### Aleatory Books - Owner

###### December 2017 - January 2020

- Designed, built, and maintained e-commerce website.
- Curated and purchased a focused selection of new/used/rare books
- Responsible for all accounting, permitting, customer service, and other business needs.
- Oversaw all marketing and communication through social media, email, events, and community building.

## Education

#### Epicodus - Full-Stack Development Certificate - Ruby on Rails/React.js

###### October 2019 – May 2020

- Independently completed over 1000 hours of class time, 17 weekly projects that passed code review from instructors, and 2 group projects.
